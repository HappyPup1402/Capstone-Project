# Capstone-Project
In the fall semester of my senior year at UC Merced, I was assigned to a group project to design an improved employee training program for Western Digital. The company was dissatisfied with their current system, complaining about issues like lack of customization, outdated methods, and disorganized information that led to low employee retention rates. Our objective was clear: significantly improve their training management system. My role primarily involved developing the back-end infrastructure of the envisioned solution â€” a centralized platform. This platform aimed to streamline communication, enhance efficiency, and efficiently track employee training progress.
